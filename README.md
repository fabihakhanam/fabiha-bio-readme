# fabiha-bio-readme

My name is Fabiha. I am a rising senior in Highschool in New York City. I am originally from Bangladesh but moved to the U.S. when I was six years old. I have been exploring computer science since 9th grade after taking a few courses with Kode with Klossy and Girls Who Code that really peaked my interest in the field. I love how Computer Science connects STEM and creativity. I am pursing a career in technology and GitHub will help me reach that goal. Github is a industry wide use platform that allows others to connect and code together. I wish to learn more about this enviroment and grow from it as well. I want to be able to collaborate with others, commit and fill up green spaces in my activity box, and explore. 

In my free time I love to read and paint. Right now, I am reading "Happy Place" by Emily Henry which is very entertaining. I look forward to connecting and learning more about the field!
